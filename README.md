# hcp

The `hcp` CLI lets you administer [HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP)](https://cloud.hashicorp.com)
resources and services. You can interact with `hcp` directly or integrate it in
scripts to automate your workflows. The HCP CLI is available across most
platforms and lets you efficiently execute common platform tasks and manage HCP
resources at scale.
